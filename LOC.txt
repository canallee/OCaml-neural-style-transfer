We are copying-paste these following source codes from OCaml Torch, 
since we need to create custom helper functions from helper functions 
in source code not avaliable in corresponding .mli files

Here are the source codes that we copied into our system:
    - In 'img_helper.ml' we copied line 11-27 from Torch_vision imagenet.ml
    the LOC for this part of copy is 13
    - In 'vgg_custom' we copied line 10-126 from Torch_vision vgg.ml
    the LOC for this part of copy is 113

The total number of LOC needs to be deducted is therefore 126
